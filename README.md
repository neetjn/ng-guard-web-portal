# Guard Web Portal

Guard was a licensing system I wrote late highschool, early college to help manage subscriptions for my online gaming community. This project is the source code for the web management portal I developed between 2012 and 2014 (I was 16-18 at the time). This is vanilla PHP 5 and CSS. Due to lack of options at the time, I used jQuery for asynchronous functionality. This web portal was running on top of a typical LAMP stack. The purpose of this web portal was to provide a clean and easy to use interface for managing user profile data, subscription information, forum account tracking, and developer projects.

This was my first stand-alone web application, so there are some unconventional methodologies being used.
